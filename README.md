# HMM
A prototype implementation of a Hidden Markov Model

# Some Notes
- I've tested the model with results shown by Eisner in his paper on Markov models. It can be found [here](https://cs.jhu.edu/~jason/papers/).
- I've added some comments to the `hmm.py` with information about how to use the model. This is very barebones documentation, and I'll add a more extensive how-to guide on this readme soon.
